Dr. Young: Taped patient interview. Subject has no recorded name, alias listed as the Joker.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
In the room is Warden Sharp and myself, Dr. Young.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
Joker: (Ugh) is this another one of those boring psych evaluation tests?

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Dr. Young: No, it’s not. So, you're the famous Joker.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
Joker: In the flesh. So Doc, do you want me to look at the ink blots again?

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
The first one is a kitten I had when I was a child.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000

Dr. Young: Very funny. Now let’s skip the jokes.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Warden Sharp: Be quiet, clown!

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Dr. Young: Every doctor that has ever interviewed you claims a different type of psychosis.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Everything from multiple personality disorders to well... the list is endless.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Joker: (soft giggle) Well, I do my best.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Dr. Young: Well, I don’t believe it. Anything can be cured with the correct treatment.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Joker: And... you think... you can cure me?

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Dr. Young: Oh, I know I can.
